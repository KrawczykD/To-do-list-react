# To do List

## To do list build in react

### I built to do list application in React.
 
 Thanks to that you can add, delete tasks to your list. But this application is better than others because use React components. You can also thick important notice, till date and finish date. You can also check the task history.
 
 I use React JS, CSS and HTML build this. This project learn me how to manage data by using react and is. I use React features like state and stateless components and new ES6 features like arrow function or new if statement.
